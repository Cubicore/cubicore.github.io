title: DHT11 Temperature and Humidity Sensor using Lorfi-WB
---

# Description

The DHT11 sensor is a digital temperature and humidity sensor that provides calibrated output for reliable and stable performance over time. It integrates a high-performance 8-bit microcontroller and combines a resistive humidity sensing element with an NTC thermistor for temperature measurement. Known for its accuracy, fast response, and strong resistance to interference, the DHT11 is also cost-effective. Each sensor is individually calibrated in a humidity chamber, with calibration data stored in OTP memory to ensure consistent readings. Its single-wire serial interface simplifies communication, while its small size, low power consumption, and ability to transmit signals up to 20 meters make it suitable for a wide range of applications, including more demanding environments.

# Specification

- Supply Voltage: +5 V
- Temperature range: 0-50 °C error of ± 2 °C
- Humidity: 20-90% RH ± 5% RH error
- Interface: Digital

## Hardware Setup

|     Module    |   Lorfi WB  |
|---------------|-------------|
| Signal        | GPIO2       |
| VCC           | 5V          |
| GND           | GND         |

Connect the Signal pin of the sensor to the Digital Input GPIO2 on the Lorfi board, connect the GND pin to GND port, VCC pin to 5V port.

#### Using directly Lorfi-WB

You can find complete <a href="/docs/Hardware_Guide.html">Lorfi-WB IO pinout here</a>.

*MIGHT NEED TO ADD NOTES ON POWER REQUIREMENTS, PIN CONSIDERATIONS, ETC.*

#### Using Lorfi Interface board

You can find complete guide for <a href="/docs/Hardware_Guide.html">Lorfi Interface here</a>.

## Software Setup

Lorfi-WB is built around the ESP32 chipset and supports both Wi-Fi and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). This must be added to Arduino IDE.

Here's the guide on <a href="/docs/Software_Guide.html">how to add ESP32 board on your Arduino IDE</a>.

Once ESP32 board is added, you can now select it from the board selection.

## Sample Code

```c
#include <DHT11.h>
DHT11 dht11(2);

void setup() {
    Serial.begin(9600);
}

void loop() {
    int temperature = 0;
    int humidity = 0;

    // Attempt to read the temperature and humidity values from the DHT11 sensor.
    int result = dht11.readTemperatureHumidity(temperature, humidity);

    if (result == 0) {
        Serial.print("Temperature: ");
        Serial.print(temperature);
        Serial.print(" °C\tHumidity: ");
        Serial.print(humidity);
        Serial.println(" %");
    } else {
        // Print error message based on the error code.
        Serial.println(DHT11::getErrorString(result));
    }
}
```
