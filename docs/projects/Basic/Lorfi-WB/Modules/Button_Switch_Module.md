title: Digital Push Button Module using Lorfi-WB
---

# Description

This is a simple push-button module that's perfect for getting started with Arduino. Just plug it into an I/O shield to begin experimenting.


# Specification

- Supply Voltage: 3.3V to 5V
- Interface: Digital
- Dimensions: 30*20mm
- Weight: 4g
- Wide voltage range from 3.3V to 5V
- Easily recognizable interfaces of sensors (“A” for Analog and “D” for Digital)
- Standard assembled hole
- Clear icons illustration
- High quality connector
- Easy to plug and operate
- Large button and high-quality cap
- To achieve interesting and interactive works

## Hardware Setup 

|     Module    |   Lorfi WB  |
|---------------|-------------|
| Signal        | GPIO2       |
| VCC           | 5V          |
| GND           | GND         |

Connect the Signal pin of sensor to Digital Input of the Lorfi board, negative pin to GND port, positive pin to 5V port.

#### Using directly Lorfi-WB

You can find complete <a href="/docs/Hardware_Guide.html">Lorfi-WB IO pinout here</a>.

*MIGHT NEED TO ADD NOTES ON POWER REQUIREMENTS, PIN CONSIDERATIONS, ETC.*

#### Using Lorfi Interface board

You can find complete guide for <a href="/docs/Hardware_Guide.html">Lorfi Interface here</a>.

## Software Setup

Lorfi-WB is built around the ESP32 chipset and supports both Wi-Fi and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). This must be added to Arduino IDE.

Here's the guide on <a href="/docs/Software_Guide.html">how to add ESP32 board on your Arduino IDE</a>.

Once ESP32 board is added, you can now select it from the board selection.

## Sample Code:
```c
#define inputPin 2

void setup() {
  pinMode(inputPin, INPUT);     // set pushbutton as input
}
void loop(){
  int val = digitalRead(inputPin);  // read input value
  if (val == HIGH) {            // check if the input is HIGH
    Serial.println("Button Pressed");
  } else {
    Serial.println("No action");
  }
}
```
