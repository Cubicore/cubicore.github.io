# Single Relay Module using Lorfi-L

# Description

This single relay module is suitable for use in interactive projects and features a high-quality SINGLE 5V relay. It's capable of controlling lights, electrical appliances, and other equipment. Its modular design allows for easy integration with Arduino boards. The module can be operated via a digital I/O pin, making it ideal for switching devices like solenoid valves, lamps, motors, and other components that require high current or high voltage.

## Hardware Setup

|     Module    |   Lorfi L   |
|---------------|-------------|
| Signal        | PB5         |
| VCC           | 5V          |
| GND           | GND         |

Connect the Signal pin of sensor to Digital Input of the Lorfi board, negative pin to GND port, positive pin to 5V port.

#### Using directly Lorfi-L

You can find complete <a href="/docs/Hardware-Guide.html">Lorfi-L IO pinout here</a>.

*MIGHT NEED TO ADD NOTES ON POWER REQUIREMENTS, PIN CONSIDERATIONS, ETC.*

#### Using Lorfi Interface board

## Software Setup

Lorfi-L is based on RAK3172 LoRaWAN module. This must be added to Arduino IDE.

Here's the guide on <a href="/docs/Software-Guide.html">how to add RAK3172 on your Arduino IDE</a>.

Once RAK3172 is added, you can now select it from the board selection.

If failing, test the UART connection by checking the version. Use `AT+VER=?` command with baud rate of 115200. In case of MCU brick, revive the RAK3172 by following this [guide from RAKwireless](https://learn.rakwireless.com/hc/en-us/articles/26687606549911-How-To-Guide-STM32CubeProgrammer-for-RAK-Modules).

## **Sample Code**
```c
#define Relay PB5

void setup() {
  pinMode(Relay, OUTPUT);  //Set Pin3 as output
}
void loop() {
  digitalWrite(Relay, HIGH);    //Turn off relay
  Serial.println("Relay ON!");  //Print that relay is ON!
  delay(2000);
  digitalWrite(Relay, LOW);     //Turn on relay
  Serial.println("Relay OFF!");  //Print that relay is OFF!
  delay(2000);
}
```
