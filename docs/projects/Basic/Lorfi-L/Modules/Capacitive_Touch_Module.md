# Capacitive Touch Sensor using Lorfi-L

# Description

Looking for an alternative to traditional mechanical buttons? Try using a capacitive touch sensor. Commonly found in modern electronic devices, this sensor adds a sleek, interactive element to your Arduino projects.

It detects touch from the human body or metal objects and outputs a corresponding high or low voltage signal. The sensor can even detect touch through materials like cloth or paper, although sensitivity decreases as the thickness of the material increases.

Future improvements to this type of sensor module aim to enhance performance and user experience.


# Specification

- Supply Voltage: 3.3V to 5V
- Interface: Digital
- Size: 30*20mm
- Weight: 3g

## Hardware Setup 

|     Module    |   Lorfi L   |
|---------------|-------------|
| Signal        | PB5         |
| VCC           | 5V          |
| GND           | GND         |

Connect the Signal pin of sensor to Digital Input of the Lorfi board, negative pin to GND port, positive pin to 5V port.

#### Using directly Lorfi-L

You can find complete <a href="/docs/Hardware-Guide.html">Lorfi-L IO pinout here</a>.

*MIGHT NEED TO ADD NOTES ON POWER REQUIREMENTS, PIN CONSIDERATIONS, ETC.*

#### Using Lorfi Interface board

## Software Setup

Lorfi-L is based on RAK3172 LoRaWAN module. This must be added to Arduino IDE.

Here's the guide on <a href="/docs/Software-Guide.html">how to add RAK3172 on your Arduino IDE</a>.

Once RAK3172 is added, you can now select it from the board selection.

If failing, test the UART connection by checking the version. Use `AT+VER=?` command with baud rate of 115200. In case of MCU brick, revive the RAK3172 by following this [guide from RAKwireless](https://learn.rakwireless.com/hc/en-us/articles/26687606549911-How-To-Guide-STM32CubeProgrammer-for-RAK-Modules).

## **Sample Code**
```c
#define Sensor PB5

void setup() {
  pinMode(Sensor, INPUT);      //Set touch sensor pin to input mode
  Serial.begin(9600);
}

void loop() {
  if (digitalRead(Sensor) == HIGH) {  //Read Touch sensor signal
    Serial.println("Sensor Touched!");    // if Touch sensor is HIGH, print "Sensor Touched!"
  } else{
    Serial.println("Sensor Untouched!");  // if Touch sensor is LOW, print "Sensor Untouched!"
  }
  delay(100);
}
```
