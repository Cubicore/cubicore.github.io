- Supply Voltage: 3.3V to 5V
- Interface: Digital
- Dimensions: 30*20mm
- Weight: 4g
- Wide voltage range from 3.3V to 5V
- Easily recognizable interfaces of sensors (“A” for Analog and “D” for Digital)
- Standard assembled hole
- Clear icons illustration
- High quality connector
- Easy to plug and operate
- Large button and high-quality cap
- To achieve interesting and interactive works

## Hardware Setup 

|     Module    |   Lorfi L   |
|---------------|-------------|
| Signal        | PB5         |
| VCC           | 5V          |
| GND           | GND         |

Connect the Signal pin of sensor to Digital Input of the Lorfi board, negative pin to GND port, positive pin to 5V port.

#### Using directly Lorfi-L

You can find complete <a href="/docs/Hardware_Guide.html">Lorfi-L IO pinout here</a>.

*MIGHT NEED TO ADD NOTES ON POWER REQUIREMENTS, PIN CONSIDERATIONS, ETC.*

#### Using Lorfi Interface board

## Software Setup

Lorfi-L is based on RAK3172 LoRaWAN module. This must be added to Arduino IDE.

Here's the guide on <a href="/docs/Software_Guide.html">how to add RAK3172 on your Arduino IDE</a>.

Once RAK3172 is added, you can now select it from the board selection.

If failing, test the UART connection by checking the version. Use `AT+VER=?` command with baud rate of 115200. In case of MCU brick, revive the RAK3172 by following this [guide from RAKwireless](https://learn.rakwireless.com/hc/en-us/articles/26687606549911-How-To-Guide-STM32CubeProgrammer-for-RAK-Modules).

## **Sample Code**
```c
#define inputPin PB5

void setup() {
  pinMode(inputPin, INPUT);     // set pushbutton as input
}
void loop(){
  int val = digitalRead(inputPin);  // read input value
  if (val == HIGH) {            // check if the input is HIGH
    Serial.println("Button Pressed");
  } else {
    Serial.println("No action");
  }
}
```
