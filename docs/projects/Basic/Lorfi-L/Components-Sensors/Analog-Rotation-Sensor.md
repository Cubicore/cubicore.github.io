# Analog Rotation Sensor using Lorfi-L

# Description

This analog rotation sensor is compatible with Arduino and is built around a potentiometer. It provides a voltage output that can be divided into 1024 steps, making it easy to connect to an Arduino using a sensor shield. By reading the analog values through an IO port, it can be combined with other sensors to create a variety of interactive projects.

# Specification

- Supply Voltage: 3.3V to 5V
- Interface: Analog
- Size: 30*20mm
- Weight: 8g

## Hardware Setup

|     Sensor    |   Lorfi WB  |
|---------------|-------------|
| Signal        | A0          |
| VCC           | 5V          |
| GND           | GND         |

Connect the S pin of module to Analog A0 of the Lorfi board, connect the negative pin to GND port, positive pin to 5V port.

#### Using directly Lorfi-L

You can find complete [Lorfi-L IO pinout here].

## Software Setup

Lorfi-L is based on RAK3172 LoRaWAN module. This must be added to Arduino IDE.

Here's the guide on <a href="/docs/Software-Guide.html">how to add RAK3172 on your Arduino IDE</a>.

Once RAK3172 is added, you can now select it from the board selection.

If failing, test the UART connection by checking the version. Use `AT+VER=?` command with baud rate of 115200. In case of MCU brick, revive the RAK3172 by following this [guide from RAKwireless](https://learn.rakwireless.com/hc/en-us/articles/26687606549911-How-To-Guide-STM32CubeProgrammer-for-RAK-Modules).

## **Sample Code**
```c
#define Sensor PB3

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);  //Open the serial to set the baud rate as 9600bps
}
void loop() {
  int sensorValue = analogRead(Sensor);
  // print out the value you read:
  Serial.println(sensorValue);
  delay(100);  // delay in between reads for stability
}
```

## Expected Output

Once the code is succesfully uploaded you must see the following output or behavior.
