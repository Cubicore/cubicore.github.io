# PIR Motion Sensor using Lorfi-L

# Description

The pyroelectric infrared motion sensor detects infrared radiation emitted by moving people or animals and produces a corresponding switch signal. It's suitable for various applications involving human motion detection. Traditional pyroelectric infrared sensors typically rely on a separate infrared detector, dedicated chip, and complex circuitry, resulting in larger size, more complicated design, and reduced reliability.

This updated version, designed specifically for Arduino, features an all-in-one digital pyroelectric infrared sensor. It offers a more compact form factor, improved reliability, lower power consumption, and a simplified circuit, making it easier to integrate into projects.

## Hardware Setup

|     Module    |   Lorfi L   |
|---------------|-------------|
| Signal        | PB5         |
| VCC           | 5V          |
| GND           | GND         |

Connect the Signal pin of the sensor to the Digital Input PB5 on the Lorfi board, connect the GND pin to GND port, VCC pin to 5V port.

## Software Setup

Lorfi-L is based on RAK3172 LoRaWAN module. This must be added to Arduino IDE.

Here's the guide on <a href="/docs/Software-Guide.html">how to add RAK3172 on your Arduino IDE</a>.

Once RAK3172 is added, you can now select it from the board selection.

If failing, test the UART connection by checking the version. Use `AT+VER=?` command with baud rate of 115200. In case of MCU brick, revive the RAK3172 by following this [guide from RAKwireless](https://learn.rakwireless.com/hc/en-us/articles/26687606549911-How-To-Guide-STM32CubeProgrammer-for-RAK-Modules).

## **Sample Code**
```c
#define Sensor PB5

void setup()
{
  pinMode(Sensor,INPUT);
  Serial.begin(9600);
}
void loop()
{
  byte state = digitalRead(Sensor);
  if(state == 1){
    Serial.println("Somebody is in this area!");
  }else if(state == 0){
    Serial.println("No one!");
    delay(500);
  }
}

```

Once the code is succesfully uploaded you must see the following output or behavior.
