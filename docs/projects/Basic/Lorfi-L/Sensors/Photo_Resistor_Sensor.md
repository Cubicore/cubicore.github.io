title: Photo Resistor Sensor using Lorfi-L
---

# Description

Photocells, often found in everyday applications, are primarily used in smart switches and general electronic designs. To enhance usability and efficiency, ready-to-use modules are available. As semiconductor devices, photocells offer high sensitivity, fast response, consistent spectral characteristics, and stable R-values. They maintain strong performance even in harsh conditions like high temperature and humidity. Common applications include automatic control systems in devices such as cameras, solar garden lights, lawn lamps, currency detectors, clocks, novelty items, night lights, and sound/light-activated switches.

# Specification

- Interface type: analog
- Working voltage: 5V
- Size: 30*20mm
- Weight: 3g

## Hardware Setup

|     Module    |   Lorfi L   |
|---------------|-------------|
| Signal        | PB5         |
| VCC           | 5V          |
| GND           | GND         |

Connect the S pin of module to Analog A0 of the Lorfi board, connect the negative pin to GND port, positive pin to 5V port.

#### Using directly Lorfi-L

You can find complete <a href="/docs/Hardware_Guide.html">Lorfi-L IO pinout here</a>.

*MIGHT NEED TO ADD NOTES ON POWER REQUIREMENTS, PIN CONSIDERATIONS, ETC.*

#### Using Lorfi Interface board

You can find complete guide for <a href="/docs/Hardware_Guide.html">Lorfi Interface here</a>.

## Software Setup

Lorfi-L is based on RAK3172 LoRaWAN module. This must be added to Arduino IDE.

Here's the guide on <a href="/docs/Software_Guide.html">how to add RAK3172 on your Arduino IDE</a>.

Once RAK3172 is added, you can now select it from the board selection.

</p>

If failing, test the UART connection by checking the version. Use `AT+VER=?` command with baud rate of 115200. In case of MCU brick, revive the RAK3172 by following this [guide from RAKwireless](https://learn.rakwireless.com/hc/en-us/articles/26687606549911-How-To-Guide-STM32CubeProgrammer-for-RAK-Modules).

## **Sample Code**
```c
///Arduino Sample Code
#define Sensor PB5
int val;

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);  //open serial port, and set baud rate at 9600bps
}
void loop() {
  int val = analogRead(Sensor);  //plug vapor sensor into analog port 0
  Serial.print("Moisture is ");
  Serial.println(val, DEC);  //read analog value through serial port printed
  delay(100);
}

```
